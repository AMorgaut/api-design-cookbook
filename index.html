        This document captures common practices in designing APIs that fit well into the Web platform as
        a whole, using WebIDL [[!WEBIDL]].

        As it currently stands, this document is nothing more than a proposal from its editor, with no
        backing implied or otherwise from any other party.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Over a relatively short period of time the number of different APIs being created for use on the
        Web has grown at a sustained pace. In working on these interfaces, many in the community discuss
        the benefits of certain approaches over others and reach agreement as to the preferred solution when
        facing a given problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping track of all these gems is however difficult given the volume of work being carried on
        in parallel and the sometimes disjointed nature of the groups involved. As a result, it can take
        a long while and many arguments repeated almost identically before a good solution becomes common.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's more, it is altogether too rare to garner feedback from developers who are actually using
        these features in their day-to-day work. Because of this, several APIs have shipped with issues
        that could have been caught earlier on in the process. This document therefore also endeavours
        to elicit feedback from developers in order to make it more readily available to API designers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to capture such ideas as they appear and accrete them over time so as
        to constitute a repository of knowledge on this topic. As a guide it does not however attempt to
        supplant editors' brains in making decisions as to how to design their APIs, and consequently one
        must keep in mind that the reasoning behind a specific recommendation is often more important than
        its result. Furthermore, in some cases there may not be a single consensual best approach, and 
        editors will need to understand the tradeoffs involved in order to pick what works for them amongst
        a set of options.
